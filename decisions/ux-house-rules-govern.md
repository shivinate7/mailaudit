# MANIFEST screens follow the house UX rules

MANIFEST screens follow the house UX rules. The rules are in the claude-settings record `ux-house-rules`. Each Swift screen lane runs them, and each rule has a check that the lane runs.

**Holds while:** `src/app.jsx` renders the screens, and the claude-settings record `ux-house-rules` holds the rule ids this repo cites.

## The ruling

The owner ruled on 2026-10-11: "apply the latest from claude settings' ux guidelines, along with /design-review /ci-hygiene /fresh-prose". The same ruling adds: "when acting upon your plan".

A repo design record can add to a house rule. It cannot cancel one.

## The rules that the 2026-10-11 rulings apply

- ux-press-moves-nothing: a press moves no other content. The records `armed-reset-takes-the-row` and `motion-disclosure-panels-arrive` apply it.
- ux-a11y-floor: a touch target is 44 by 44 CSS px on touch. The record `action-row-is-ruled-cells` applies it.
- ux-thumb-zone: the main action on a phone sits in reach of the thumb. The record `phone-nav-awaits-mockup` holds the open question.
